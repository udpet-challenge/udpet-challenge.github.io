![](assets/overview.jpg)

## To Participants

Dear participants of the Ultra-Low Dose PET Imaging (UDPET) Challenge,

We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your interest and valuable contributions to the UDPET imaging challenge over the past three years. We are thrilled to announce the continuation of the challenge with UDPET 2025.
A comprehensive workshop will be held at IEEE MIC 2025 on November 8th. Participants ranked within the top 10 will be invited to present their work at the IEEE MIC 2025 Ultra-low-dose PET imaging workshop, which can be found at the following link: https://nssmic.ieee.org/2025/program/.

- Availability of the evaluation code: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2n1mqFz_QCP4G3A9pXk88TOrcdiWUNi/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2n1mqFz_QCP4G3A9pXk88TOrcdiWUNi/view?usp=sharing)

- Test data release date: **Oct. 20th**. The test data will be in nifti format (Unit:Bq/ml) with an extra CSV file that contains meta information present in the dicom header (weight, injected activity, the difference between acquisition datetime and radiopharmaceutical start datetime, radioisotope half life). The decay correction attribute (dicom tag: (0054,1102)) of all the test data is "START" ([https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/positron-emission-tomography-image/pet-series/00541102](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/positron-emission-tomography-image/pet-series/00541102)).

- Submit the necessary material before the DDL_2 of 23:59 (pacific day time)
    - A short paper or abstract about your method (maximum 1-page or 500 words whatever is reached first)
    - Algorithms scripts or link to your Github repository
    - Generated Full dose image in nifti format (Unit:Bq/ml), recovered from dose reduced images in Test dataset

- Prize: 1st Place 1600 USD, 2nd Place 1000 USD, 3rd Place 600 USD

- The top 3 ranked teams will be eligible for an award and the best 5 classified teams will have the chance to present their work at theworkshop hosted at IEEE NSS/MIC on the 8th of November (10 mins talk + 2 mins questions).
