Dear participants of the Ultra-Low Dose PET Imaging (UDPET) Challenge,

We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your interest and valuable contributions to the UDPET imaging challenge over the past two years. We are thrilled to announce the continuation of the challenge with UDPET 2024. This year’s challenge will incorporate a broader and more diverse dataset acquired on two commercial Total-Body PET systems, uExplorer (United Imaging) and Biograph  Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers), to solidify the trust in methodological developments and enhance the clinical translational potential of the outcomes.

A comprehensive workshop will be held at IEEE MIC 2024 on October 29th. Participants ranked within the top 10 will be invited to present their work at the IEEE MIC 2024 Ultra-low-dose PET imaging workshop, which can be found at the following link: https://nssmic.ieee.org/2024/program/.
