## Train Dataset

- The dataset contains 1447 subjects of whole-body 18F-FDG PET imaging, acquired from Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra (n=387) and United Imaging uEXPLORER (n=1060).
- All data was acquired in list mode allowing for a rebinding of data to simulate different acquisition times. Each simulated low statistics corresponding to low dose PET with a certain dose reduction factor (DRF) was reconstructed from the counts of a time window resampled at the middle of the acquisition with correspondingly reduced time. Low statistics corresponding to low dose image will be provided with DRF at 4, 10, 20, 50 and 100, as well as full dose image. All these low-dose PET are produced by subsampling a portion of the full scan, so they should be perfectly aligned with the full dose PET.
