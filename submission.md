For successful participation and consideration for prizes, participants will be required to submit:  
- A short paper or abstract about your method (maximum 1-page or 500 words whatever is reached first)
- Algorithms scripts or link to your Github repository  
- Generated Full dose image in nifti format (Unit:Bq/ml), recovered from dose reduced images in Test dataset (Please put all predictions in a separate folder and use the same filename as the input file. You can send us by email with a google drive link to your folder that contains your output test data.)
- Pre-registration via email to [yizhou.chen@students.unibe.ch](mailto:yizhou.chen@students.unibe.ch) OR [alejandro.lopez@unibe.ch](mailto:alejandro.lopez@unibe.ch) by Oct. 12th to confirm a submission by the deadline (Oct. 27th). 
    
It includes:
- test.zip: newly collected 50 subjects low statistics corresponding to low dose PET scanned with Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra (n=20) and United Imaging uEXPLORER (n=30). 
<!-- **To be noted: we will not provide the information of Dose reduction factor for each test case this year.** -->
- Organ\_segmentation\_example.zip: Examples of organ segmentations used for evaluation.

Submitted generated images should:

- use the same file structure as test.zip
- voxel value using the same unit as test.zip -- Bq/mL
- all images are stored in compressed nifty file (.nii.gz)

Submission should be directly send to [yizhou.chen@students.unibe.ch](mailto:yizhou.chen@students.unibe.ch) OR [alejandro.lopez@unibe.ch](mailto:alejandro.lopez@unibe.ch) via Email
